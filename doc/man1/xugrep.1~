.SH NAME 
xugrep \- Extract strings in the language of grammar production

.SH SYNOPSIS 
.B  xugrep [--r2] 
.I  xupath
.I  file
.B  ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
xugrep(1) generalizes 
.BR grep(1)
; xugrep(1) extracts all strings that match an
XUPath from one or more files.  

Traditional 
.BR grep(1) 
extracts all lines in a file that contain strings in
the language of a regular expression.  
.BR grep(1) 
outputs a sequence of
strings that match a regular expression with some amount of
surrounding context expressed in lines.  The positions of those
strings are line numbers.

xugrep(1) generalizes the class of languages that we can practically
extract on the UNIX command line from regular to context-free.  

The xupath specifies the language of the strings to extract.  The
slashes between xupath productions correspond to intersection between
the languages of the productions referenced at each step.  The
resultant language (upon intersection) is not guaranteed to be
context-free.    

All files are processed in the order specified.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP --RE
If set to LE, this tells our tool to escape newlines within each of
the result strings so that each match fits neatly on a single line.
In future implementations, a practitioner should be able to specify
how to escape the newline since different characters are meaningful to
different file formats.

.SH FILES
Currently, the xugrep(1) command operates on hard-coded grammars.  In
future releases, however, it will operate on grammars in the XUPATH.  

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP XUPATH 
The path at which the xutools grammar library resides.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Currently there are no error codes.  In future releases, however, will
will be thinking more carefully about error codes and how to report
these errors back to the calling environment.  

.SH BUGS
There are likely plenty as this is the first release of xugrep(1).
