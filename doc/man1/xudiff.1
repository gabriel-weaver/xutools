.SH NAME 
xudiff \- Compare two files in terms of parse trees generated by a context-free or regular grammar

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xudiff
.I xupath
.I file1
.I file2

.SH DESCRIPTION
xudiff(1) generalizes 
.BR diff(1) 
to compare files in terms of their
respective parse trees generated by a context-free or regular
grammar.  

Traditional 
.BR diff(1) 
computes an edit script between the sequences of
lines in a file.  
.BR diff(1) 
outputs an edit script that describes how to
transform the sequence of lines in the first file into the sequence of
lines in the second file via a sequence of edit operations (insert,
delete, update).  

The xupath specifies the grammar by which to parse both files.
Currently, we expect a xupath that results in a single parse tree
(not a forest).  

The files are processed in the order specified.  

.SH OPTIONS 
.IP --count 
The production that should be used to do the cost function in the
dynamic programming matrix.  By default, inserts and deletes of
parse-tree nodes cost 1.  Updates of nodes with the same label cost 0
and otherwise 1.  However, one could also calculate cost in terms of
edit distance between labels in terms of bytes, characters, or words.
For larger files, this may be slow due to the size of the dynamic
programming matrix.  Likewise, 'bigger chunks' such as paragraphs, may
be faster than comparing lines.

.SH FILES
Currently, the xudiff(1) command operates on hard-coded grammars.  In
future releases, however, it will operate on grammars in the XUPATH.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP XUPATH
The path at which the xutools grammar library resides

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Currently there are no error codes.  In future releases, however, we
will be thinking more carefully about error codes and how to report
these errors back to the calling environment.

.SH BUGS
There are likely plenty as this is the first release of xudiff(1).
