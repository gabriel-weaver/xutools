XUTools Ourea (Oὔρεα):  6.1.2013
================================
The goal of this release was to refactor the previous implementation 
to use the xutools.corpus module.  The goal of this module is to allow
practitioners to formalize textual analysis techniques as operations
on a language (a set of strings).  So far we have implemented XUGrep
and XUWc using this abstraction.  In the future, we will refactor
XUDiff to use this library as well.  In this release we focused
primarily on Cisco IOS and TEI-XML data sets.  Finally, we reworked
the man pages to include examples as well as a description of xupath
and the XUTools Grammar Library.

We named this release Oὔρεα as much of it was developed in the
mountains of Hanover, NH during my Ph.D thesis.  Thank you to Sean
W. Smith (my advisor), Rakesh B. Bobba, Thomas H. Cormen, Doug
McIlroy, and Daniel Rockmore for their help and guidance through this
process.  

We want this release (with the corpus-as-language abstraction) to
provide a strong foundation upon which to extend these tools in the
future.
