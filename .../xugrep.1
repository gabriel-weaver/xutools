.SH NAME 
xugrep \- Extract strings in the language of grammar production

.SH SYNOPSIS 
.B  xugrep 
.I  xupath
.I  file
.B  ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
xugrep(1) generalizes 
.BR grep(1)
; xugrep(1) extracts all strings that match an
XUPath from one or more files.  

Traditional 
.BR grep(1) 
extracts all lines in a file that contain strings in
the language of a regular expression.  
.BR grep(1) 
outputs a sequence of
strings that match a regular expression with some amount of
surrounding context expressed in lines.  The positions of those
strings are line numbers.

xugrep(1) generalizes the class of languages that we can practically
extract on the UNIX command line from regular to context-free.  

The xupath specifies the language of the strings to extract.  More
information many be found in the man page for xupath.  

All files are processed in the order specified.

.SH OPTIONS
The current version of xugrep(1) does not have any options.  

.SH FILES

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Currently there are no error codes.  In future releases, however, will
will be thinking more carefully about error codes and how to report
these errors back to the calling environment.  

.SH BUGS
There are likely plenty as this release of xugrep(1) incorporates a
new API for text corpora.  Bug reports are welcomed, we want to make
these tools as strong as possible.

.SH EXAMPLES

.SS Cisco IOS
.P
.B xugrep \(dq/builtin:file/ios:interface\(dq ./data/test/cisco_ios/router.v1.example ./data/test/cisco_ios/router.v2.example | sort -k 1
.br
Extract all Cisco IOS interfaces within both files.  Sort the results
by the file from which the interfaces were extracted.

.br
Extract the lines per interface within the Cisco IOS router

interface, then by the file from which they were extracted.

.P
.B xugrep \(dq/builtin:file/ios:interface/builtin:line[re:testsubtree('access-group','e')]\(dq ./data/test/cisco_ios/router.v1.example | sort -k 3 | sort -k 2 | sort -k 1
.br
